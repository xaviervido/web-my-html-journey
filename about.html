        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is David Osmau, and I’m an aspiring web developer. 
            My journey into the world of coding began as a challenge to myself. 
            Starting from absolute zero knowledge, I’ve worked my way through the struggles 
            of understanding HTML and CSS. Today, I’m proud to share my story of transformation.

        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Why I Started Learning Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            It all began with curiosity. I wanted to create something meaningful on the web, 
            but I had no idea where to start. After countless Google searches, I stumbled upon 
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>, a platform that 
            changed everything for me. Through their structured curriculum, I discovered the magic of HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Love About Coding</h2>
        <p>
            The most fulfilling part of coding is turning ideas into reality. 
            Every line of code brings a design to life, and every solved bug feels like a small victory. 
            Coding is more than just a skill; it’s a way to express creativity and problem-solving.
        </p>

        <h2>What’s Next for Me?</h2>
        <a href="./gallery.html/happy.jpg"></a>
        <p>
            I’m excited to continue growing as a developer. My next steps include mastering JavaScript, 
            learning responsive design, and eventually diving into full-stack development. The journey never ends, 
            and I’m here for it!
        </p>
